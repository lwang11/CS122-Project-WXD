# CS122-Project-
CS122 2018 Group Project

Data downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/hugodarwood/epirecipes/data

Scripts in our project:
1.	Vector_space.py, a python file containing data preprocessing and vector space model construction
2.	BM25.py, a python file containing data preprocessing and probabilistic BM-25 model construction
3.	Scrapeimage.py, a python file scraping image from google

Files in our project:

All results are saved to shorten running time.
1.	For Vector_space.py, doc_length, documents, index_in_json, inverted_index, word_set are saved
2.	For BM25.py, doc_length_BM25, documents_BM25, index_in_json_BM25, inverted_index_BM25, word_set_BM25 are saved

To run the project:
1.	Install pip in your terminal (if have not done so)
2.	Go to “Cookbook” folder, run:
python3 manage.py runserver
3.	Go to 127.0.0.1:8000/search/
4.  If you want to use a different model, go to views.py in cookbook/search/views.py, change "from BM25 import *" to "from Vector_space import *"

To run model evaluation:
1.  Please change the directory into "evaluation" folder.
2.  Run python project.py.
3.  You can see the scoring process shown in the terminal and it will print the score for ten queries we selected for both TFIDF model and BM25 model.
4. Please open the evaluation.xlsx file to see the histogram for comparing NDCG value for two models.

Responsibilities:
1.	Data Preprocessing: Wenxi Xiao 
2.	Build models and algorithms: Lerong Wang, Wenxi Xiao, Yangyang Dai
3.	Django user interface: Lerong Wang, Yangyang Dai
4.  Model Evaluation: Wenxi Xiao
